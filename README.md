# Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF) for Generative Modeling

<p align="center">
<em>Only 1 GPU is required.</em>
</p>

**IDFF** is a novel generative modeling framework that simultaneously learns an implicit flow and a scoring model.  
These components operate jointly during sampling, enabling fast, accurate generation across both images and time-series data.

Thanks to its momentum-driven structure, **IDFF reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by more than 10×** compared to traditional conditional flow matching (CFM) models, while improving sampling quality and trajectory coherence.

## 🔬 Key Features

- **Implicit Score-and-Flow Fusion**: Combines score-based and flow-based generative models in a unified second-order SDE framework.
- **Momentum-aware Sampling**: Dynamically modulates sample generation with first- and second-order gradients, controlled by `γ₁` and `γ₂`.
- **Versatile Domains**: Supports both 2D synthetic distributions (e.g., checkerboard, spirals) and high-dimensional molecular dynamics (MD) data.
- **Fast Inference**: High-quality samples with as few as 2–3 function evaluations.
- **Easy Integration**: Compatible with `torchdiffeq` and `torchsde` solvers; plug in your own models.

## 🧪 2D Toy Example: Checkerboard

We demonstrate the effect of IDFF on a synthetic 2D distribution using KDE overlays and trajectory visualization.

- Models tested:  
  - Standard CFM  
  - IDFF with various $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ configurations

- Metric: **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)**  
  - IDFF achieves lower MMD than CFM even with fewer NFEs

**Run:**
```bash
python run_checkerboard.py
````

## 🧬 Molecular Dynamics: PolyALA

We apply IDFF to molecular dynamics simulations, specifically backbone dihedral trajectories from PolyALA protein chains.

* Objective: Learn to generate future frames conditioned on current dynamics.
* Architecture: MLP-based embedding model trained with Exact Optimal Transport CFM.
* Output: Generated trajectories, phase space plots, and metrics like RMSE, MAE, CC.

**Train & Evaluate:**

```bash
python run_md_simulation.py
```

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

IDFF is evaluated on both low- and high-dimensional tasks using:

* **MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy)**
* **KL Divergence**
* **RMSE / MAE / Pearson CC**
* **Phase Space Trajectories**

| Model                                 | MMD ↓     | KL ↓      | RMSE ↓   | CC ↑     |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| CFM (baseline)                        | 0.063     | 0.412     | 0.51     | 0.86     |
| IDFF \$(\gamma\_1=0.2, \gamma\_2=5)\$ | **0.031** | **0.208** | **0.39** | **0.93** |

## ⚙️ Usage Overview

### 1. **2D Generation Example**

```bash
python run_checkerboard.py
```

### 2. **Molecular Dynamics Simulation**

```bash
python run_md_simulation.py
```

You can customize the following parameters:

* `gamma1`, `gamma2`: momentum modulation
* `nfe`: number of function evaluations
* `dataset_name`: e.g., `polyALA`
