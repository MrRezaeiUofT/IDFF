# Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF) for Generative Modeling

<p align="center">
<em>Only 1 GPU is required.</em>
</p>


**IDFF** is a novel generative modeling framework that simultaneously learns an implicit flow and a scoring model.  
These components operate jointly during sampling, enabling fast, accurate generation across both images and time-series data.

Thanks to its momentum-driven structure, **IDFF reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by more than 10√ó** compared to traditional conditional flow matching (CFM) models.

## üî¨ Key Features

- Combines score-based and flow-based generative models in a unified second-order SDE framework.
- Dynamically modulates sample generation with first- and second-order gradients, controlled by `Œ≥‚ÇÅ`, `Œ≥‚ÇÇ`, ...
-  Supports both 2D synthetic distributions (e.g., checkerboard, spirals) and high-dimensional molecular dynamics (MD) data.
- **Fast Inference**: High-quality samples with as few as 2‚Äì3 function evaluations.
- **Easy Integration**: Compatible with `torchdiffeq` and `torchsde` solvers; plug in your own models.

## üß™ 2D Toy Example:

We demonstrate the effect of IDFF on a synthetic 2D distribution using KDE overlays and trajectory visualization.

- Models tested:  
  - Standard CFM  
  - IDFF with various $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ configurations

- Metric: **Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)**  
  - IDFF achieves lower MMD than CFM even with fewer NFEs

**Run:**
```bash
python 2D_examples/Autograd_example_order2.py
````

## üß¨ Molecular Dynamics: PolyALA

We apply IDFF to molecular dynamics simulations, specifically backbone dihedral trajectories from PolyALA molecular chains.

* Objective: Learn to generate dynamics of PolyALA molecular chain.
* Architecture: MLP-based embedding model trained with IDFF.
* Output: Generated trajectories, phase space plots, and metrics like RMSE, MAE, CC.

**Train & Evaluate:**

```bash
python timeseris_example/MD_simulation.py
```

You can customize the following parameters:
* `gamma1`, `gamma2`: momentum modulation
* `nfe`: number of function evaluations
